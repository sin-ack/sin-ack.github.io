      <div class="content">
        <p>In my <a href="/posts/a-tour-of-self/">previous post</a>, I talked about Self and gave a
general tour of the language and the programming environment. I mentioned that
Self was an image-based programming language. Of course, if you want to develop
a Self application with multiple people, an image is not suitable for
collaborating (except in real-time &ndash; we&rsquo;ll come back to that in a later post).
Your Self image contains everything in your programming environment (provided
you don&rsquo;t forget to save it!), including the active morphs you have on the
screen, and stuff you are working on. Therefore, obviously, it is not possible
to collaborate using your world images on version control.</p>
<p>So then the question becomes &ldquo;How can we extract just the parts of our
application so that they can be re-imported to other Self worlds independently?&rdquo;
And the answer to that is the Transporter system.</p>
<p>But before we can talk about Transporter, we first need to understand what Self
considers a module.</p>
<h2 id="self-modules">Self Modules</h2>
<p>We previously talked about slots and objects in Self and said that an object is
a collection of slots. Well, all of our world is a huge hierarchy of objects
created by connections of slots. Obviously it would be very hard to put
everything together at once. Besides, we might want to plug some stuff out or
plug new stuff in at will.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where Self modules come in. For the most part, modules behave like you
would expect from other programming languages: modules are collections of
objects. However, they differ from regular programming language modules in that
they also contain <em>individual slots</em>. That is, you can set a module for any
slot, in any object. This makes Self&rsquo;s modules incredibly powerful in extending
the language: by making the granularity of modules in Self at the slot level,
you can extend the standard library as you wish, adding new slots.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/string_asFileContents.png"
         alt="asFileContents is probably not something you would expect to be on traits string."/><figcaption>
            <p><code>asFileContents</code> is probably not something you would expect to be on
<code>traits string</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In that screenshot you can see that right after the category name (<code>files</code>),
there is a bit that says <code>Module: abstract_OS</code>. In the programming environment,
at the top of each object and category, there is a summary of the modules that
own the slots. If there is only one module for all slots, it will show the
module name like above; if there are multiple, it will abbreviate it and show
the module count instead; and if there are none, it will show
<code>no filed-out slots</code> (might be familiar if you followed the previous post).<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/globals_modules.png"
         alt="The module summary for globals, using the morphic snapshot."/><figcaption>
            <p>The module summary
for <code>globals</code>, using the <code>morphic</code> snapshot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We will soon look into how we can create our own modules. For now, let&rsquo;s
understand how the Transporter system works.</p>
<h2 id="the-transporter-system">The Transporter system</h2>
<p>The Transporter system is a way to reliably extract a module from a Self world
while the code is still running. It accomplishes this by getting the
representation of each object and slot that belongs to the module (and is
well-known<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>) and transforming them into a series of messages which can then
be written to a file. This file is a text file which then be shared as you would
with any other text file.</p>
<p>The handbook has an
<a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/howtoprg.html#the-transporter">excellent section</a>
on how Transporter works and the problems that were faced. You should definitely
check it out, but to summarize, live objects and slots do not provide enough
information to accurately represent them in source code (a slot might be
computed initially, how to handle slots that reference another module&rsquo;s objects,
how to handle immutable objects), so in order to preserve that information for
<em>filing into</em> (loading into) another Self world later, the information is set by
the programmer as <em>annotations</em> on the objects and slots. Let us now look at
what annotations are and what kind of annotations there are.</p>
<h2 id="self-annotations">Self Annotations</h2>
<p>To solve the problem of storing meta-data on the object regarding its creation,
Self has a syntactic element called <em>annotations</em>. Annotations are strings that
are stored with the object or slot and can then be fetched by the environment.
The default Self environment and Transporter separates different keys and values
in an annotation with <code>\x7f</code>. In text form, slots and objects can be annotated
using curly braces.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/annotation_syntax.png"
         alt="Annotations in text form."/><figcaption>
            <p>Annotations in text form.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In an object, there are a few annotations that are relevant to the Transporter
system, and the environment provides a graphical way to modify them.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/object_annotations.png"
         alt="The annotations that are available on an object."/><figcaption>
            <p>The annotations that are available on an object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the screenshot above, the first two slots are related to Transporter. We will
come back to copy-down in a later post, so ignore the last 3 slots for now.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>creator slot</em> is the well-known path for this object. All objects that
refer to this object must use the creator slot to do so. This also allows
your object to get its own name, as we will see later in this blog post.</li>
<li>The <em>Complete?</em> flag allows us to determine whether there is an expression
such that, provided all required objects are filed in, lets us recreate this
object 1:1. This is used by Transporter to write simple expressions to
recreate slot contents.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>An important thing to note is that, for an object to be accurately recreated, it
must either be complete or it must have a well-known creator slot.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/creator.png"
         alt="traits string has a well-known creator path: you can always access it by evaluating traits string."/><figcaption>
            <p><code>traits string</code>
has a well-known creator path: you can always access it by evaluating
<code>traits string</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img src="/images/self2/complete.png"
         alt="This textLines object is complete: when filing out, Transporter will simply write &amp;lsquo;foo&amp;rsquo; asTextLines. You can create the object this way yourself."/><figcaption>
            <p>This <code>textLines</code>
object is complete: when filing out, Transporter will simply write
<code>&lsquo;foo&rsquo; asTextLines</code>. You can create the object this way yourself.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For slots, we have a few more annotations. They determine how the slot will be
represented when Transporter files them out.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/slot_annotations.png"
         alt="The annotations
that are available on a slot."/><figcaption>
            <p>The annotations
that are available on a slot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This one is much simpler. A slot has a <em>module</em> it belongs to, and has two modes
when determining how to initialize it when filing it in later. If <em>Follow</em> is
selected, then Transporter will try to write out whatever&rsquo;s the value of the
module; if <em>Initialize to</em> is selected, however, Transporter will place the
expression that&rsquo;s typed in the text box as the slot&rsquo;s value.</p>
<p>Okay, now that we know all of this, we can write our own module and file it out,
so let&rsquo;s do it.</p>
<h2 id="writing-our-own-module">Writing our own module</h2>
<p>Here, I am creating an object with basic mathematical operations.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/object_creation.png"
         alt="Creating the objects
on the slot."/><figcaption>
            <p>Creating the objects

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure><img src="/images/self2/object.png"
         alt="The final version of the
object."/><figcaption>
            <p>The final version of the
object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>First, let&rsquo;s define the module for the slots on this object. Middle-click on
the object&rsquo;s header (the part with <code>a slots object</code>) and select <code>Set Module...</code>
Select <code>All</code> slots, and select module as <code>other</code>. For name, we can enter
<code>maths</code> and then click <code>Okay</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_1.png"
         alt="Selecting Set Module."/><figcaption>
            <p>Selecting
<code>Set Module</code>.</p>

         alt="Steps of setting module to maths."/><figcaption>
            <p>Steps of setting module
to <code>maths</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self will warn us that the module we are trying to save to does not exist, but
we already know this. Click on <code>Create it!</code></p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_3.png"
         alt="Self telling us that
there is no such module."/><figcaption>
            <p>Self telling us that
there is no such module.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self will then ask us to add this module as a submodule of another. This is good
for organization, but we want this module to be standalone, so leave this
textbox empty and click <code>Okay</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_4.png"
         alt="Leaving the parent module
empty."/><figcaption>
            <p>Leaving the parent module

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self will be surprised because we&rsquo;re creating a new root module, but that&rsquo;s
fine; click <code>No module</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_5.png"
         alt="Self is very shocked at
this turn of events."/><figcaption>
            <p>Self is very shocked at
this turn of events.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For the final step, we determine which directory our module will reside in. The
directory <code>applications</code> is fine, so let&rsquo;s just accept the default.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_6.png"
         alt="Selecting the directory
of the application."/><figcaption>
            <p>Selecting the directory
of the application.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And there we go, we just created our first module.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_module_success.png"
         alt="The object now displays the module as maths."/><figcaption>
            <p>The object
now displays the module as <code>maths</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But wait! If we file out our module now, we will not be able to reach the slots
we just created in any form. This is because the object we created has no
<em>creator slot</em>. If you recall from earlier, we said that objects need to have a
well-known creator slot to be filed out. A very simple way to do this is to
just put our slot on <code>globals</code>, as most modules do.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s add a new slot to <code>globals</code> as we did previously with other objects. If
you cannot find the &ldquo;Add Slot&hellip;&rdquo; option in the object menu, make sure you are
clicking on the outliner&rsquo;s header area. For now, we are setting it to <code>nil</code>,
because we will be setting it to our object later on.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/global_slot_1.png"
         alt="Adding a new slot to
global."/><figcaption>
            <p>Adding a new slot to

        </figcaption>
</figure>

         alt="The newly added slot."/><figcaption>
            <p>The newly added slot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can now carry the connector that&rsquo;s currently connected to <code>nil</code>, and drag it
over the object we have created.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/global_slot_connector.png"
         alt="Dropping the
connector on the object."/><figcaption>
            <p>Dropping the
connector on the object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If done right, <code>maths</code> will now show <code>a slots object</code> as its value. But we&rsquo;re
not done yet; we now have the slot correctly set up, but we need to annotate
the creator of our object (which we can now do, because the object is globally
accessible).</p>
<p>Middle-click on our object, and select &ldquo;Show Annotation&rdquo;, then set it to <code>maths</code>
and save it with the green button.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/set_creator.png"
         alt="Setting the creator of
our object."/><figcaption>
            <p>Setting the creator of
our object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At this point, our object (now knowing its creator path) identifies itself as
<code>maths</code>. The object is now globally accessible and ready for filing out.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/maths.png"
         alt="The object now identifies itself as maths."/><figcaption>
            <p>The object now
identifies itself as <code>maths</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Before we file out, it is often important to check the <em>expatriate slots</em> list.
The Expatriate Slots list contains the slots which exist on well-known objects,
but do not belong to any module in our Self world. We can check it by
middle-clicking the background, selecting <code>Changed Modules</code> (which will list our
module), and middle clicking on the <code>Changed Modules</code> morph and selecting
<code>Expatriate Slots (not in any module)</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/expat.png"
         alt="Expatriate Slots list."/><figcaption>
            <p>Expatriate Slots list.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And what do you know, we did forget a slot: we never set the module of the
<code>maths</code> slot on <code>globals</code>. Because slots each belong to their own module, we
need to set it so that the <code>maths</code> slot belongs to our module. So let&rsquo;s middle
click on the <code>maths</code> slot, select <code>Show Annotation</code>, enter the module as <code>maths</code>
and accept.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/maths_annotation.png"
         alt="Annotating the maths slot."/><figcaption>
            <p>Annotating the
<code>maths</code> slot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now if we middle-click <code>Changed Modules</code> again, the menu item will say
<code>No Expatriate Slots</code>, which means we correctly assigned modules to all our
slots and can now file them out.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/no_expat.png"
         alt="We don&amp;rsquo;t have any other
expatriate slots."/><figcaption>
            <p>We don&rsquo;t have any other
expatriate slots.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To write out our module, simply click the <code>W All</code> button on the
<code>Changed Modules</code> morph, which will file out all changed modules. It should
briefly flash a window mentioning writing out <code>maths</code>, and the title should
change to <code>No Changed Modules</code>. You can now find the <code>maths.self</code> file in
<code>applications</code> in the same directory as Self if you&rsquo;re running the kitchen sink
snapshot, or in <code>objects/applications</code> in the parent directory if you&rsquo;re running
the Morphic snapshot.</p>
<h2 id="filing-in-modules">Filing in modules</h2>
<p>To end this post, let&rsquo;s file in the module we just filed out. Quit Self by
selecting <code>Quit &gt; Just quit</code> from the background menu, then open it again. Our
<code>maths</code> object will be gone from <code>globals</code>, but we can add it back in now that
we have filed our module out. Select <code>New shell</code> from the background menu, open
a new prompt by clicking the &ldquo;E&rdquo;, and enter the path of the .self file relative
to where you executed Self, followed by <code>runScript</code>.</p>
<figure><img src="/images/self2/filing_in.png"
         alt="Filing in our maths module."/><figcaption>
            <p>Filing in our
<code>maths</code> module.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Once you click <code>Do it</code>, and open &ldquo;Globals&rdquo; from the background menu, you should
see <code>maths</code> there.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this blog post. There is still a lot to cover about
Transporter, and Self in general, so there will be more posts to come. In my
next post, I will take a look at the Morphic user interface, and how to build
simple interfaces in it. Stay tuned!</p>
<p><small>As a final tidbit, you can file out the standard modules in the snapshot
by selecting &ldquo;All Modules&rdquo; from the background and clicking &ldquo;W&rdquo; for the module
from the menu you get. This way, you can look at the standard library source in
text form.</small></p>
