        <p>Hey there. This is the first post I will be making here, and I wanted to give a
tour of Self before making posts about my current implementation, mySelf.</p>
<p>Throughout this post, I will be showing examples from the regular implementation
of the Self programming environment, available
<a href="https://github.com/russellallen/self">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-self">What is Self?</h2>
<p>To quote the <a href="https://selflanguage.org/">Self language homepage</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language,
environment, and virtual machine centered around the principles of simplicity,
uniformity, concreteness, and liveness. Self includes a programming language, a
collection of objects defined in the Self language, and a programming
environment built in Self for writing Self programs. The language and
environment attempt to present objects to the programmer and user in as direct
and physical a way as possible. The system uses the prototype-based style of
object construction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Self was designed at Xerox PARC by David Ungar and Randall B. Smith in 1986, and
was implemented at Stanford University. Development then continued at Sun
Microsystems before eventually stopping in the early 2000s.</p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-to-self">An introduction to Self</h2>
<p>Self is an image-based programming language, similar to Smalltalk. It provides
a <em>programming environment</em> that you interact with as the system is running. The
runtime is based on the idea of &ldquo;processes&rdquo;: each piece of Self code you run has
its own process (not an OS process &ndash; a Self process) in which it runs until
termination. During its runtime it can interact with other objects it can reach,
and create new ones.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/processes.png"
         alt="Two processes: The left one is the scheduler (the root process), and the right one is a short-lived one created by the shell when I typed process this and evaluated it."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Two processes: The left one
is the scheduler (the root process), and the right one is a short-lived one
created by the shell when I typed <code>process this</code> and evaluated it.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each object holds a number of slots, which can be added to and removed from
(facilitated by the programming environment). Slots can be mutable, in which
case they accept a message with their name and the new value as an argument.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/slots.png"
         alt="This object has a mutable slot named foo (marked by the colon on the right). I can send it a message like foo: &amp;lsquo;bar&amp;rsquo; to set the value it points at to &amp;lsquo;bar&amp;rsquo;. Constant slots (like parent above) are marked with an equals sign."/> <figcaption>
            <p>This object has a mutable slot
named <code>foo</code> (marked by the colon on the right). I can send it a
message like <code>foo: &lsquo;bar&rsquo;</code> to set the value it points at to &lsquo;bar&rsquo;.
Constant slots (like <code>parent</code> above) are marked with an equals sign.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Objects can also hold code when they are assigned to a slot, in which case the
slot is called a <em>method</em>, and the code will be executed when a message is sent
to that slot. Methods can take arguments, and the keywords for each argument
after the first must start with a capital letter (due to the way message
precedence works in Self).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/methods.png"
         alt="This object holds a method called bark, which will pop up a dialog box when it receives a message."/> <figcaption>
            <p>This object holds a method
called <code>bark</code>, which will pop up a dialog box when it receives a
message.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Self, unlike most object-oriented languages, is one which employs <em>prototypes</em>
for inheritance (like Javascript). Prototypes are objects which are the
canonical instance of a type. New &ldquo;instances&rdquo; are created by copying, or
cloning, the prototype and modifying its properties. Cloning is the only way to
create new &ldquo;instances&rdquo; in Self.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/cloning.png"
         alt="Cloning a vector. The object
on the left is the vector prototype, and the one on the right is the &amp;ldquo;instance&amp;rdquo;
that I have created by cloning the prototype, marked by the &amp;ldquo;a&amp;rdquo; before its name."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Cloning a vector. The object
on the left is the vector prototype, and the one on the right is the &ldquo;instance&rdquo;
that I have created by cloning the prototype, marked by the &ldquo;a&rdquo; before its name.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, if you know a bit about Smalltalk (and Objective-C, sort of), in the
previous picture you might have spotted that I sent a message named <code>size</code> in
order to get the size of the newly created vector. You might ask &ldquo;how did the
vector know how to respond to <code>size</code>&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s where <em>parent slots</em> come in.
In the image, <code>parent</code> is marked with a <code>*</code>, which signifies that it is a parent
slot. When a message is to be sent to a Self object, first the regular slots of
the object is searched, and if the slot is not found there, the parent is
searched, and this operation continues recursively until it reaches an object
which doesn&rsquo;t have a parent (for most Self objects, this is <code>globals</code>, which
we will talk more about later).</p>
<p>Note that parent slots can be mutable too. You can change the behavior of an
object while it exists in Self (dynamic inheritance!).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/parent_slot.png"
         alt="vector&amp;rsquo;s parent slot traits vector contains the defintion for the message size."/> <figcaption>
            <p><code>vector</code>&rsquo;s
parent slot <code>traits vector</code> contains the defintion for the message
<code>size</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One more thing you need to know about is <em>blocks</em>, which you might be familiar
with if you know Smalltalk or Objective-C. They are objects which hold a block
of code, and they execute the code and return the value when they are sent the
<code>value</code> message (they are just regular objects with special syntax, after all).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/blocks.png"
         alt="A block which reports the
number it is given."/> <figcaption>
            <p>A block which reports the
number it is given.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is almost all of the Self syntax. There is not much else to talk about with
regards to the language itself, because the rest of the Self system is
constructed in the programming environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-self-programming-environment">The Self Programming Environment</h2>
<p>All of the screenshots that I showed you were from Morphic, Self&rsquo;s programming
environment interface. In Self, the easiest way to interact with the system is
by using the programming environment. The user interface is built using Morphic,
which is the UI framework powering the environment, built on X11 on GNU/Linux
and Quartz on macOS.</p>
<p>In order to use one of these snapshots,</p>
<p>When you first start the <code>morphic</code> or <code>kitchensink</code> snapshots, you are greeted
with something like this:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/self_window.png"
         alt="The initial window."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The initial window.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>From here, there are a few ways you can start using the programming environment.
First thing you should know is that there are usually two types of context menus
for each <em>morph</em> (widget or layout, in modern terms) in the workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>object menu</em>, which contains operations related to the functionality of
the morph. This can be setting the target for a button, or adding a slot to the
object that the outliner points to. It is opened with the middle click.</li>
<li>The <em>morph menu</em>, which contains operations related to the morph itself, and
ways of modifying it. For instance, you can click <code>Resize</code> to resize the
morph. It is opened with the right click.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/menus.png"
         alt="The object (yellow) and morph
(blue) menus."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The object (yellow) and morph
(blue) menus.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you want to do something to what the morph is showing, you middle click it.
If you want to change the morph itself, you right click it.</p>
<p>The background is middle-clickable, as well, and contains many important menu
items. It is where you find the options to create a new object, and references
to some important objects in the Self environment.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/bg_menu.png"
         alt="The background (rootMorph) menu."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The background (<code>rootMorph</code>) menu.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s build the standard FizzBuzz as an example, going through the Self
programming environment while we do so. First off, let&rsquo;s create a new object and
give it a few slots. <code>parent</code> will help us access the rest of the Self
environment via its value, <code>traits oddball</code> (trait for objects that are
one-of-a-kind, singleton if you must); <code>n</code>, which will be a mutable slot holding
the current number; and <code>fizzBuzzList</code>, which is what we will store our results
in (because we don&rsquo;t have a terminal to print to). To do this, I first
middle-click the world and create a new object. Then I middle-click the outliner
(which are morphs that list the slots in an object, like an inspector) for the
new object, and select &ldquo;Add Slot&rdquo;. This opens an editor in which I can enter the
code for this slot. I enter the slot values for <code>parent</code>, <code>fizzBuzzList</code> and
<code>n</code>.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/add_slot.png"
         alt="Adding a slot to the new object."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Adding a slot to the new object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/slot_editor.png"
         alt="The editor for the new slot."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The editor for the new slot.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One thing to note is that we can do the association of slots with values
completely interactively. Let&rsquo;s do this for the <code>fizzBuzzList</code> slot. First, I
will middle-click the world and select &ldquo;Globals&rdquo;, which will open the <code>globals</code>
object containing all world-reachable objects in Self (of which there are many).</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/globals.png"
         alt="The globals object."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The globals object.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then I find the object I want (<code>sequence</code> for storing a sequence of values),
which is under <code>core &gt; collections &gt; ordered</code>. The standard library is nicely
organized and it is a lot of fun to discover what is available visually.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/find_sequence.png"
         alt="Finding sequence in globals."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Finding <code>sequence</code> in <code>globals</code>.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We then fetch the object by clicking the symbol on its right, and create an
instance of it by opening the prompt and sending it the message
<code>copyRemoveAll</code> to get a sequence with no values in it.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/sequence_copy.png"
         alt="Copying the sequence prototype."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Copying the sequence prototype.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Finally, I can associate this object with the <code>fizzBuzzList</code> slot in my new
object. I click the symbol next to <code>fizzBuzzList</code>, which pulls down <code>nil</code>. I
then drag the connector from <code>nil</code> to the new <code>sequence</code> instance I just
created, and it is now set. Of course, this is much easier to do by setting the
value of <code>fizzBuzzList</code> to <code>sequence copyRemoveAll</code> during slot creation, but
this allows you to set the value of slots to objects that are not well-known
(cannot be reached from <code>globals</code>), like the instance of <code>sequence</code> we had just
created. Plus, it is super cool to navigate the standard libarary.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/images/tour1/drag_connector.png"
         alt="Dragging the connector to the sequence."/> <figcaption>
            <p>Dragging the connector to the sequence.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

         alt="The final version
of our object, with all the slots we need."/> <figcaption>
            <p>The final version
of our object, with all the slots we need.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s evaluate some code to fill up that sequence. I click the &ldquo;E&rdquo; icon on
the top right corner of the object to open up a <em>prompt</em>. I can then enter code
here, and either &ldquo;get it&rdquo; (getting the result of the last statement) or &ldquo;do it&rdquo;
(just execute the code without grabbing any value).</p>
<p>This is the code for FizzBuzz:</p>

<span class="o">].</span>
<span class="n">fizzBuzzList</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When I execute this code, it will do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will first send <code>1</code> the <code>to:Do:</code> message, creating a range loop during
which our outer block will execute.</li>
<li>In the block, we receive a parameter called <code>i</code> (denoted by the <code>:</code> before
the variable&rsquo;s name). In Self, to have control flow, we use blocks. Both
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> accept the <code>ifTrue:False:</code> message with each executing the
corresponding block. To have an if-else chain, we simply nest blocks.</li>
<li>The rest is just regular FizzBuzz: we check the modulos, and pass the correct
value to <code>fizzBuzzList add:</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, we return the list object we just populated, so we can grab the
object when we press &ldquo;get it&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>

         alt="FizzBuzz in the prompt."/> <figcaption>
            <p>FizzBuzz in the prompt.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After we execute this code with &ldquo;Get it&rdquo;, it will attach <code>fizzBuzzList</code> to the
cursor, which we can drop somewhere to inspect. <code>sequence</code> stores the items in
it in an inner <code>vector</code> (which it wraps to expose an easy API for adding new
items in it). We can list the elements in the vector by expanding <code>Indexable</code>.
As you can see, the vector is now populated with the FizzBuzz game.</p>

<p>Of course, simple programming examples are not the only thing you can do in
Self. The standard library is super rich (after all, Self was developed in Sun
Microsystem for a new years, who are notorious for another language with a very
large standard library). In particular, the Morphic system is an extremely cool
UI toolkit which I definitely want to talk more about, but I don&rsquo;t want my first
post to become extremely long, so I&rsquo;ll end it here for now.</p>
<p>I definitely recommend you to spend at least some time with Self yourself.
Download it from the link at the top of this post. Currently, Self is only
available for x86, PPC and Sparc, because development stopped before ARM and
x86_64 became really popular. You can probably still emulate it with QEMU on
ARM, though I have not had a chance to try this. Before running, make sure your
<code>/dev/</code> partition is mounted as <code>exec</code> (the reason is that Self uses an old
method of portably allocating heap memory by <code>mmap</code>ing <code>/dev/zero</code> with <code>O_EXEC</code>
set). Then run:</p>
<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">$ ./Self -s kitchensink.snap</code></pre></div>
<p>I recommend the kitchen sink image because it contains everything that has been
developed for Self (more stuff to play around with). However, you can also try
the &ldquo;morphic&rdquo; and &ldquo;core&rdquo; images (be warned, the core image does not contain the
Morphic environment!).</p>
<p>Now you can use what I have talked about so far to play around with objects. Use
the &ldquo;Outliner for morph&hellip;&rdquo; option from the menu to navigate the UI objects
themselves. The &ldquo;^&rdquo; button on outliners is really handy for exploring the
hierarchy of objects. You can also use &ldquo;Find slot&hellip;&rdquo; from the object menu to
search for messages that a given object accepts (which will traverse all parents
up to <code>globals</code>). Have fun! Be sure to also check out <a href="https://handbook.selflanguage.org/2017.1/">the
documentation</a>, though I find it kind
of lackluster (in particular, it contains pretty much nothing about the huge
standard library, and much of the programming environment&rsquo;s functionality is
learnt through trial-and-error, which I hope to change with these posts).</p>
<p>In my next post, I will showcase using Transporter, and how you can file out
Self objects from your world so that it can be imported to other worlds, or
checked into version control. Stay tuned!</p>
