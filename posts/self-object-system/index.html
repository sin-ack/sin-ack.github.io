        <p>When I <a href="/posts/a-tour-of-self/">first introduced Self</a>, I mentioned that Self is
a programming language which employs <em>prototype-based inheritance</em>; it does not
depend on a class-instance distinction to facilitate object-oriented
programming, but rather, it uses a <em>prototype object</em> from which copies are
created. The methods associated with a prototype is stored in a <em>traits object</em>
which is just another object storing methods that can be used on a prototype and
all its copies through a parent slot.</p>
<p>The trouble begins when we actually try to implement this prototype-based
inheritance system as an actual virtual machine, particularly with regards to
memory consumption. Say that I have a prototype object <code>point</code> with a constant
parent slot pointing to <code>traits point</code> and two assignable slots, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When we copy this object, we would expect to copy all three fields. But
if we scale that up, that&rsquo;s so much unnecessary data being copied! For one, for
every copy of the <code>point</code> prototype we make, we&rsquo;re copying that <code>traits point</code>
parent slot reference. Not to mention, because our language is dynamic, we can&rsquo;t
simply treat <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as offsets into memory, because they might be constant
or assignable (Self can&rsquo;t intrinsically know). So our naive implementation would
be pretty inefficient.</p>
<p>Can we make this more memory-efficient? In fact, we can; we can exploit the fact
that most Self objects that are copied only ever have their assignable slots
modified. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how the original developers of Self have
optimized the memory usage of the Self virtual machine.</p>
<p>A little heads-up before we begin: This one&rsquo;s going to be a less hands-on post
as I&rsquo;m mainly going to be talking about implementation details of the VM itself
rather than the Self programming environment.</p>
<h2 id="the-key-insight">The key insight</h2>
<p>Just in the previous paragraph I mentioned that most objects in Self only ever
have their assignable slots modified. In fact, this isn&rsquo;t just some rule of
thumb: there is no assignment slot for constant slots, so you cannot modify the
constant slots of an object through regular methods like you would with
assignable slots<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, we could just reduce the copy of an object to the contents
of the assignable slots and keep the rest of the object itself as a separate
&ldquo;information&rdquo; structure that tells the VM what is supposed to be what.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what the original developers of the Self VM did. They called
their invention an &ldquo;object map&rdquo;. An <em>object map</em> (called just &ldquo;map&rdquo; hereafter)
stores all the information the Self VM needs to know about an object, such as
the parent slots, constant slots, etc. Using the map, we can reduce the amount
of memory we require for a copy of our <code>point</code> prototype object to just two
memory words (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>) plus some book-keeping to point to the map itself.</p>
<h2 id="self-object-references">Self object references</h2>
<p>For things like integers and floating point numbers, even the book-keeping would
be too much memory. For a 64-bit integer, just adding a pointer to a map doubles
our memory footprint! So, the authors of Self turned to good-old pointer tagging
for object references.</p>
<p>In the Self virtual machine, all object references have their bottom two bits
used as a tag. The possible values are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integers are given <code>00</code>, because that makes adding, subtracting and comparing
them a single assembly instruction (because there&rsquo;s no bitwise ops
required)<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li>
<li>For object references, we can exploit the fact that all our objects will be
aligned to the nearest machine word. They are tagged by simply binary ORing
the bottom two bits with <code>01</code>. Then they can be ANDed out when the pointer to
the memory space needs to be dereferenced.</li>
<li>Floats are marked with <code>10</code>. Since the bottom two bits of the float is part of
the mantissa, we can simply AND the bits away at the cost of a little
precision loss.</li>
<li>Finally, <em>object markers</em> are tagged with <code>11</code>. We will talk about object
markers shortly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this means that our integers are 62-bit and our floats lose some
precision in their last decimal places, but it is probably better than carrying
around an additional 8 bytes (more if we want to mark our objects).</p>
<p>Note that newer techniques like NaN boxing are not used in Self. There are a
couple reasons for this: first, from what I can tell, NaN boxing became more
widely used in the early-to-mid 90s while Self&rsquo;s design was created in the late
80s; and second, Self&rsquo;s dynamic inheritance and dynamic typing means that most
objects we would optimize by boxing into NaNs require carrying around a parent
slot pointer (48 bits in modern systems and possible 64 bits in the future),
leaving not enough space for other attributes (i.e. the size value in vectors).</p>
<h2 id="self-objects-in-memory">Self objects in memory</h2>
<p>So what do Self objects in memory actually carry? Well, they consist of the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A machine word for the <em>object marker</em> that we talked about above. Object
markers are used to mark the start of an object.</li>
<li>A machine word for the <em>map reference</em> for this object. It&rsquo;s simply a tagged
pointer pointing to a map.</li>
<li>If the object is a vector or byte vector object, an additional machine word is
added for the number of items.</li>
<li>If the object is a slots object (i.e. contains just slots), each assignable
slot follows the first two words. If the object is a vector, <code>n</code> machine words
for the items follow instead. If the object is a byte vector, a pointer to the
<em>bytevector space</em> (explained in the next section) is stored.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s all we need in order to represent a Self object with our current scheme.
The first word contains a bit more information identifying the <em>type</em> of the
object (slots, vector, bytevector, map) as well as some implementation specific
GC information.</p>
<h2 id="self-maps-in-memory">Self maps in memory</h2>
<p>Now that we described the objects themselves, let&rsquo;s look at maps, which are the
descriptor structures for the objects in memory. They contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>An object marker, just like regular objects. However, they are identified as
<em>maps</em> instead of any object type.</li>
<li>A map reference. In Self, all maps are required to have a map reference
pointing to the <em>map-map</em>, which is the map that references itself. The V8
Javascript engine calls this the <em>meta-map</em> which I like more.</li>
<li>In the third word, there is the &ldquo;garbage collection link&rdquo; which creates a
linked list out of all the maps for scavenging. There&rsquo;s also a vtable pointer
in the fourth word but that&rsquo;s an implementation detail and can be ignored.</li>
<li>The total size of the object in machine words. Since Self was designed as a
32-bit system, that&rsquo;s just the total size of the map divided by four.</li>
<li>A few pointers to <em>dependency links</em>. Dependency links are used a lot in the
compiler which is out of scope for this article. They&rsquo;re used to track changes
for invalidation of compiled code when an object changes.</li>
<li>If this map is for a method slot, then there is a machine word for the object
reference to the bytecode.</li>
<li>Following that are &ldquo;slot descriptor&rdquo; objects. They contain the name, type and
either the contents (for constant slots) or the byte offset from the object
(for mutable and assignment slots) of the slot. Vector maps only have a parent
slot<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-self-memory-space">The Self memory space</h2>
<p>The Self object system also splits Self objects and byte-vector values into two
separate sides of the address space. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/russellallen/self/master/docs/papers/implementation.pdf">The implementation
paper</a>
describes that this was done to improve the speed of scavenging<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. Since byte
vectors (i.e. strings) can have any bit pattern, it would be quite easy to
masquerade a bytevector&rsquo;s contents as an object marker by simply setting the
bottom two bits of a word to <code>11</code>. Smalltalk interpreters at the time solved
this by iterating over the memory space object-by-object (i.e. doing bounds
checking for every object) but that causes performance problems. Self was able
to achieve double the speed (3MB/s at the time, according to the paper) by
<em>segregating</em> the raw byte data to the upper area of the allocated address
space. This allows the scavenger to simply scan the entire object side of the
memory for the <code>11</code> marker instead of caring about the length of the object, for
example.</p>
<h2 id="a-more-modern-implementation-v8">A more modern implementation: V8</h2>
<p>The above information was about how Self implements its objects in the memory
space. This particular implementation was conceived in the late 80s. However, as
we all know, there is a newer and more popular language that also uses
prototype-based object-orient programming: Javascript. I wanted to know what
sort of object implementation Javascript had in a modern engine, so I started to
research how the V8 Javascript engine does it. While researching, I came across
this <a href="https://www.jayconrod.com/posts/52/a-tour-of-v8-object-representation">helpful article by Jay
Conrod</a>
which you should check out.</p>
<p>Something that surprised me was how similar V8&rsquo;s object representation was to
Self&rsquo;s object representation. Perhaps the authors were influenced by the paper,
or perhaps they simply came up with a similar representation on their own.
However, V8 seems to have a few key differences with regards to the object
representation.</p>
<h3 id="map-transitions">Map transitions</h3>
<p>In its current implementation, Self will create a new map everytime an object
has slots added or one of its constant slots modified. This is understandable,
since that makes an object diverge from others. In Self this is mostly okay,
because objects are copied wholesale from prototypes and all the properties that
an object has is known at copy-time.</p>
<p>However, Javascript has a different model, particularly for constructor
functions. When a new object is created, it is usually assigned values
one-by-one. Using Self&rsquo;s implementation, this would mean that a new map would be
created everytime. Not only that, but many duplicate maps would be created from
the re-assignments. To combat this, the V8 engine employs <em>map transitions</em>.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll take the example from Jay Conrod&rsquo;s article. When we have a constructor like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The V8 engine can create the following maps when this code is first executed:</p>
<pre><code>Map0: # Empty map
  - x: Transition(Map1)

Map1:
  - x: Field
  - y: Transition(Map2)

Map2:
  - x: Field
  - y: Field
</code></pre><p>When similar code is executed, this will slowly create a tree from the root map
to the leaves which are concrete object maps.</p>
<p>Now, to be clear, this method is neither superior or inferior when compared to
Self&rsquo;s method of just allocating a new map. In particular, in the example Map1
cannot be de-allocated because new Point objects will be using that map when
being constructed. Self does not need something like this, because most objects
are constructed at once with all their properties and copied many times.</p>
<h3 id="constant-method-fields">Constant Method Fields</h3>
<p>Another Javascript-related optimization that V8 does is to inline function
pointers as constant. This seems to be very similar to how Self holds the values
of constant slots directly in the slot descriptors.</p>
<p>Here I&rsquo;m taking another example from the V8 article. Suppose we had a
constructor like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">distance</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">PointDistance</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">PointDistance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">p</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">p</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">;</span>
  <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nb">Math</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sqrt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dx</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">dx</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">dy</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">dy</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Because we are assigning the same constant function everytime, it would not make
sense to store a reference to it in every Point instance. So the V8 runtime will
store the pointer as a constant directly in the map instead, like so:</p>
<pre><code>...

Map2:
  - x: Field
  - y: Field
  - distance: Transition(Map3)

Map3:
  - x: Field
  - y: Field
  - distance: ConstantFunction(PointDistance)
</code></pre><p>The optimizer would then replace any references to this constant function with a
direct reference to the function itself, eliminating indirection.</p>
<p>This is required in Javascript, because objects are malleable during runtime,
and new properties may be added to them at anytime; in addition, in Javascript
object properties cannot be constant unless the object is frozen. In contrast,
Self already has this feature, however it is implemented in a different way:
Because objects in normal operation are either created from scratch (with all
their properties) or cloned, the constant values are immediately embedded into
the newly created map without the need for transitions or special references to
constant functions. The bytecode compiler can then inline these constant values
just as it would with any other constant value. In Self, the Point prototype
would look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="p">(</span><span class="o">|</span>
  <span class="n">parent</span><span class="o">*</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">traits</span> <span class="n">clonable</span><span class="o">.</span>

  <span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
<span class="o">|</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Since all the constant values (<code>parent</code>, <code>copyX:Y:</code> and <code>distance:</code>) are
already known, the Self VM can create a single Map object which will embed a
reference to the methods directly.</p>
<p>Note that similar to the Javascript prototype object, in Self a <em>traits object</em>
is used to store methods that can be used on a prototype and its copies. While
this is purely an idiom, it is a good idiom nevertheless. In particular, when
new methods are added to the traits object, the existing copies can also benefit
from it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Self&rsquo;s object system still seems to hold up since its initial implementation
paper from 1989. Because the properties of Self allow it to allocate a single
map for objects and then keep it around for a long time, a feature like map
transitions does not seem to be necessary. Similarly, constant references in
maps have existed from the beginning, because Self expects the programmer to
define all slots during object creation, and makes a distinction between
constant and assignable slots.</p>
<p>There seems to be a key difference in how Javascript and Self treat the
prototype-based inheritance system too, from what I can tell: In Javascript the
<code>prototype</code> seems to have become a place to put the methods of an object. In a
way, it&rsquo;s just the &ldquo;class&rdquo; object named a different way. In Self, the prototype
object is the object that other code clones in order to get an &ldquo;instance&rdquo;. You
could say that the prototype is the &ldquo;default value&rdquo; of an object.</p>
<p>If we were to write the Javascript <code>Point</code> code above in a Self-like style, it
would look like this:</p>

</details><br />
<p>Thanks for reading. This article wasn&rsquo;t as exciting as the previous ones,
however I think it&rsquo;s still pretty interesting to look at how Self handles
objects in memory and how it compares to newer programming languages in a
similar paradigm. Also, sorry for being absent for almost 2 months from here. I
had some IRL business to take care of, however that is done and now I should be
able to post much more often. Stay tuned!</p>

<p>This is a simplified version of the initial object problem posed by the
paper. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Keyword regular. Using primitives and mirrors, you can of course change an
object&rsquo;s constant slots but that has additional side effects, like creating a
completely new map. <a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Multiplication requires one right shift, and division requires two right
shifts before and a left shift after. <a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>Curiously, the current Self implementation does allow more than just the
parent slot on vector objects, so maybe this restriction was lifted after
the implementation paper was published. <a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>We will look at Self&rsquo;s GC system in a future post. For now, just know that
scavenging is a quick GC technique that is faster than a full GC cycle. <a href="#fnref:5" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
