        <div class="content">Hi there. I wanted to do a series of deep dives about various parts of ZigSelf in order to give others a more thorough explanation of how everything works, and also as a braindump in order to verify my thinking. The first post I wanted to make is regarding ZigSelf&rsquo;s implementation of the actor model, as it&rsquo;s the feature I believe is one of the most interesting aspects of the language.</div>

Today I want to tell you a story about the time I ported the Zig compiler to SerenityOS.
I&rsquo;m going to tell you a bit about what my motivation was to do this. Then I&rsquo;ll explain the steps I took and the various challenges I faced (there were a lot of those!</div>

In my first article I had mentioned that I was going to make posts about my own implementation of Self called mySelf. That project never took off, and my interest shifted to other things. I had largely forgotten about it, but then LangJam happened.
LangJam LangJam is a programming jam that works similar to game jams, but instead of developing video games you develop a programming language based around the theme of the jam.</div>
