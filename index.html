Today I want to tell you a story about the time I ported the Zig compiler to SerenityOS.
I&rsquo;m going to tell you a bit about what my motivation was to do this. Then I&rsquo;ll explain the steps I took and the various challenges I faced (there were a lot of those!</div>

        <div class="content">Hello there. I have not posted in a while, and not without good reason. In my first article I had mentioned that I was going to make posts about my own implementation of Self called mySelf. That project never took off, and my interest shifted to other things. I had largely forgotten about it, but then LangJam happened.
LangJam LangJam is a programming jam that works similar to game jams, but instead of developing video games you develop a programming language based around the theme of the jam.</div>

        <div class="content"><p>I got the chance to investigate an interesting bug in
<a href="https://serenityos.org/">SerenityOS</a> this week. It was related to the decoding
of JPG images in the operating system. For some reason, when a JPG image is
viewed, it comes out like this:</p>
<figure><img src="/images/serenity-jpgloader/lenna-broken.png"
         alt="Lenna,
showing up with incorrect colors."/><figcaption>
            <p>Lenna,
showing up with incorrect colors.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Weird, huh? Also seems like a simple confusion of RGB vs. BGR. And sure enough,
making the following change on <code>JPGLoader.cpp</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-diff" data-lang="diff"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="gd">-   const Color color { (u8)block.y[pixel_index], (u8)block.cb[pixel_index], (u8)block.cr[pixel_index] };
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="gd"></span><span class="gi">+   const Color color { (u8)block.cr[pixel_index], (u8)block.cb[pixel_index], (u8)block.y[pixel_index] };
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="gi"></span>    context.bitmap-&gt;set_pixel(x, y, color);
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>makes the image show up correctly. Case closed!</p>
<p>&hellip;not. Why did this even break in the first place?</p></div>

        <div class="content"><p>When I <a href="/posts/a-tour-of-self/">first introduced Self</a>, I mentioned that Self is
a programming language which employs <em>prototype-based inheritance</em>; it does not
depend on a class-instance distinction to facilitate object-oriented
programming, but rather, it uses a <em>prototype object</em> from which copies are
created. The methods associated with a prototype is stored in a <em>traits object</em>
which is just another object storing methods that can be used on a prototype and
all its copies through a parent slot.</p>
<p>The trouble begins when we actually try to implement this prototype-based
inheritance system as an actual virtual machine, particularly with regards to
memory consumption. Say that I have a prototype object <code>point</code> with a constant
parent slot pointing to <code>traits point</code> and two assignable slots, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> When we copy this object, we would expect to copy all three fields. But
if we scale that up, that&rsquo;s so much unnecessary data being copied! For one, for
every copy of the <code>point</code> prototype we make, we&rsquo;re copying that <code>traits point</code>
parent slot reference. Not to mention, because our language is dynamic, we can&rsquo;t
simply treat <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> as offsets into memory, because they might be constant
or assignable (Self can&rsquo;t intrinsically know). So our naive implementation would
be pretty inefficient.</p>
<p>Can we make this more memory-efficient? In fact, we can; we can exploit the fact
that most Self objects that are copied only ever have their assignable slots
modified. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how the original developers of Self have
optimized the memory usage of the Self virtual machine.</p></div>
