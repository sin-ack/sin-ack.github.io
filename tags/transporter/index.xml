      <title>Self Transporter: how to share your Self code</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://sin-ack.github.io/posts/a-tour-of-self/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, I talked about Self and gave a
general tour of the language and the programming environment. I mentioned that
Self was an image-based programming language. Of course, if you want to develop
a Self application with multiple people, an image is not suitable for
collaborating (except in real-time &amp;ndash; we&amp;rsquo;ll come back to that in a later post).
Your Self image contains everything in your programming environment (provided
you don&amp;rsquo;t forget to save it!), including the active morphs you have on the
screen, and stuff you are working on. Therefore, obviously, it is not possible
to collaborate using your world images on version control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then the question becomes &amp;ldquo;How can we extract just the parts of our
application so that they can be re-imported to other Self worlds independently?&amp;rdquo;
And the answer to that is the Transporter system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
