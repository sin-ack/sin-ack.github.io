      <description>Hey there. This is the first post I will be making here, and I wanted to give a tour of Self before making posts about my current implementation, mySelf.
Throughout this post, I will be showing examples from the regular implementation of the Self programming environment, available here.
What is Self? To quote the Self language homepage:
 Self is a prototype-based dynamic object-oriented programming language, environment, and virtual machine centered around the principles of simplicity, uniformity, concreteness, and liveness.</description>
