      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi there. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I posted here, mostly due to real life
responsibilities. I&amp;rsquo;m planning on making monthly updates here from now on so
that I can showcase the new things that are in ZigSelf. For the first update
though, let&amp;rsquo;s play some catch-up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello there. I have not posted in a while, and not without good reason. In my first article I had mentioned that I was going to make posts about my own implementation of Self called mySelf. That project never took off, and my interest shifted to other things. I had largely forgotten about it, but then LangJam happened.
LangJam LangJam is a programming jam that works similar to game jams, but instead of developing video games you develop a programming language based around the theme of the jam.</description>
